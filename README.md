# Restaurant Orders SQL Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes a quarter’s worth of order data from a fictitious restaurant serving international cuisine. The analysis is performed using SQL to explore menu composition, pricing, order volume, item popularity, and customer spending behavior.

The project demonstrates practical SQL skills such as joins, aggregations, subqueries, filtering, and analytical reasoning using relational datasets.

- Relational database querying
- Data exploration and analysis

## Analysis Performed

### Menu Analysis
- Counted the total number of items on the menu
- Identified the least and most expensive menu items
- Analyzed Italian cuisine:
  - Number of Italian dishes
  - Least and most expensive Italian items

### Category Analysis
- Counted the number of dishes in each category
- Calculated the average price per category

### Order Analysis
- Determined the date range of the dataset
- Calculated:
  - Total number of orders
  - Total number of items ordered
- Identified orders with the highest number of items
- Found orders containing more than 12 items

### Order & Menu Integration
- Joined menu and order tables for item-level analysis
- Identified:
  - Least ordered items
  - Most ordered items
  - Categories of popular and unpopular items

### Revenue Analysis
- Calculated total spend per order
- Identified the top 5 highest-spending orders
- Analyzed item-level details for:
  - The highest-spending order
  - The top 5 highest-spending orders

---

## Key Insights
- Menu pricing varies significantly across categories
- Italian dishes represent a major portion of the menu
- A small number of orders account for a large share of total revenue
- High order value is driven more by item price than item quantity
- Popular items tend to cluster within specific categories
